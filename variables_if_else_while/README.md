# Variables, If, Else, While in C

This project explores fundamental concepts of C programming, particularly control structures and variables. It is part of the low-level programming curriculum.

## Exercise Descriptions

### Basic Concepts
* `0-positive_or_negative.c`: Program that determines if a number is positive, negative or zero
* `1-last_digit.c`: Displays the last digit of a number with specific conditions
* `2-print_alphabet.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase

### Character Manipulation
* `3-print_alphabets.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase then in uppercase
* `4-print_alphabt.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase except 'q' and 'e'
* `7-print_tebahpla.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase in reverse order

### Number Manipulation
* `5-print_numbers.c`: Prints numbers from 0 to 9
* `6-print_numberz.c`: Prints numbers from 0 to 9 using putchar
* `8-print_base16.c`: Prints numbers in base 16 (hexadecimal)

### Number Combinations
* `9-print_comb.c`: Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers
* `100-print_comb3.c`: Prints all combinations of two different digits
* `101-print_comb4.c`: Prints all combinations of three different digits
* `102-print_comb5.c`: Prints all combinations of two two-digit numbers

## Skills Developed

* Use of conditional structures (if, else)
* Loop manipulation (while)
* Working with variables and data types in C
* Using putchar and basic input/output functions
* Understanding comparison and logical operators

## Requirements

* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Programs are compiled with gcc using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files should end with a new line
* No compilation errors or warnings
* Betty style compliant code
